## Possible job roles for an RSE

#### Open science RSE
Open science and FAIRness of data and software are increasingly important topics in research,
as exemplified by the demand of an increasing amount of research funding agencies requiring openness.
Hence, an open science RSE is required to have a deeper knowledge in (\gls{RC}) and how to distribute software publicly (\gls{SRU}, \gls{SP}).
Open Science RSEs can help researchers navigate the technical questions that come up
when practising Open Science, such as "How do I make my code presentable?",
"How do I make my code citable?",
"What do I need to do to make my software \ac{FAIR}?", or
"How do I sustainably work with an (international) team on a large code base?".
Like the Data-focused RSE, they have a deep understanding of \ac{RDM} topics.

#### Project/community manager RSEs

When research software projects become larger, they need someone who manages
processes and people.
In practice, this concerns change management for code and documentation
and community work to safeguard usability and adaptability,
but also handling project governance and scalable decision-making processes.
This gap can be filled by people who invest in the (\gls{PM}), (\gls{USERS}), and (\gls{TEAM}) skills, as exemplified in @subsec:examplecareer.
Building a community around a research project is an
important building block in building sustainable software [@Segal2009], so these RSEs play
an important role, even if they do not necessarily touch much of the code themselves.

#### Teaching RSEs
RSEs interested in developing their (\gls{TEACH}) skill can focus on teaching the next generation of researchers and/or RSEs and will play
a vital role in improving the quality of research software.
They need to have a good understanding of all RSE competencies relevant to their domain and
additionally should have experience or training in the educational field.


#### User interface/user experience designers for research software
Scientific software is a complex product that often needs to be refined in order to be usable even by other scientists.
To facilitate this, there are people required that specialise in the (\gls{DOCBB}) and probably the (\gls{DIST}) competency
with a focus on making end-user facing software really reusable and hence \ac{FAIR}.
This task is supported by strong (\gls{MOD}) skills to reason about the behaviour of potential users of the software.
