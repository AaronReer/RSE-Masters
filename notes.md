# RSE Notes

## Understanding the Task

### Information Sources

- Academic (Papers on RSE)
- Community (Discussion transcripts)
- Neighbouring Didactics (SE and DDI)

### RSE Field Description

- RSE training for scientists? Or specialty for CS?
- Is there specific SE competencies for Research Software (Programming Patterns, Modelling Practices ...)?
- RSE Training for Academia ? And what is the difference for Industry?
- Academic Excellence vs. Quality Research Software
- If RSE is "CS for non CS people", does that mean it should be an overview over the whole CS field for NON-CS people or specific parts. If the latter, which parts besides SE
- Is the Curriculum for MINT RSE only?

### Target Description

- University Master (include Applied Sciences)?
- Module or Complete Master Program?
-

### Format of the Curriculum

- technology: quarto



## What is RSE-specific and not contained in other fields/curriculums

### R-SE Specific Challenges and Competency Areas for Programming

- Rapid Prototyping (Project time limit, throw-away for PhD etc.)
- Solo-Programming (Specific Challenges)
- Big Data Processing with limited resources (specific but not only for Physics)
- Programming Patterns that deal with dataframes but should be readable and object-oriented


### RSE Specific Challenges for Soft Skills

- interdisciplinary communication (i.e. intercultural communication)
- collaboration on the write level i.e. version control

### How to derive/collect RSE Specific Competencies?

- bottom up (based on competence graphs) or top down (based on existing modules, disciplines)?
