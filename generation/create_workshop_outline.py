# Invitation to the RSE Community-Master Development

We invite all members of the **Research Software Engineering (RSE)** community to join us in developing a Master's curriculum tailored to the unique needs, interests, and challenges of RSE.  
Each module represents a specific area of the RSE landscape and will be shaped by community-driven short online workshops (2â€“3 hours each).

In these workshops, we collaboratively define:

- Relevant competences
- Suggested course structures
- RSE-specific perspectives

These efforts will feed directly into the development of a comprehensive and inclusive RSE Master's curriculum.  
You can explore the broader project here: [RSE Masters Curriculum GitHub Repository](https://github.com/the-teachingRSE-project/RSE-Masters/tree/tschira-funding)

# RSE Workshops

The following topics will be dealt with in seperate workshops. These are compiled from the current module descriptions.

{% for d in descriptions %}
- {{ d.name }}
{% endfor %}

Ideas and possible contents of these workshops are listed in more detail below:

{% for d in descriptions %}

{{ d.content }}

{% endfor %}

# Join Us!

If you're passionate about any of these topics, we want your input!  
Help shape the future of RSE education by taking part in our short workshops, contributing to the repository and sharing your expertise.

To get involved, please reach out via the repository or contact the organizing team directly at julian.dehne@gi.de.
