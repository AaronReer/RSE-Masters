# Invitation to the RSE Community-Master Development

We invite all members of the **Research Software Engineering (RSE)** community and interested scientists and educators to join us in developing a Master's curriculum tailored to the unique needs, interests, and challenges of RSE.  
Each module represents a specific area of the RSE landscape and will be shaped by community-driven short online workshops (2â€“3 hours each).

The main idea is to supplement general courses on software engineering, data science and advanced science classes with RSE-specific courses tailored to the growing field of software engineering in research.
These example modules will be new in structure and content and provide universities a suggestion how to hire and support the growing need for RSE competencies. These courses will be optional in the sense that alternatives or similar
existing classes will be suggested if a spezialized lecturer is not available.

In these workshops, we collaboratively define:

- Relevant competences
- Suggested course structures
- RSE-specific perspectives

These efforts will feed directly into the development of a comprehensive and inclusive RSE Master's curriculum.  
You can explore the broader project here: [RSE Masters Curriculum GitHub Repository](https://github.com/the-teachingRSE-project/RSE-Masters/tree/tschira-funding)
