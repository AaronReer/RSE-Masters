## RSE Programming

The RSE programming module extends the Fundamentals of Computer Science module with a focus on RSE-specific programming patterns,
necessary technologies and good practices.

This includes, but is not limited to

- software re-use (see SRU in [@competencies-F1000])
- creating documented code building blocks (see DOCBB in [@competencies-F1000])
- building distributable software (see DIST in [@competencies-F1000])
- research specific programming languages
- research specific code requirements (scalability, functional programming, ...)
