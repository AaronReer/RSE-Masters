## The Missing Semester

In reference to the [MIT Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) this module tries to convey the nuts and bolts of code development.

This includes (but is not limited to):

- Shell Tools and Scripting
- Editors (Vim)
- Data Wrangling
- Command-line Environment
- Version Control (Git)
- Debugging and Profiling
- Metaprogramming

These general competencies can be extended to RSE-specific techniques such as:
