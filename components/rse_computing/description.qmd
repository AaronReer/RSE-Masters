## RSE Computing

RSEs with expertise in HPC and other performance-critical computing domains specialize in optimizing code for efficient execution across various platforms, including clusters, cloud, edge, and embedded systems. They understand parallel programming models, hardware-specific optimizations, profiling tools, and platform constraints such as memory, energy, and latency. Their skills enable them to adapt software to diverse infrastructures, manage complex dependencies, and support researchers in accessing and using advanced computing resources effectively and sustainably.
