Dear [group],

We invite all members of the **Research Software Engineering (RSE)** community and interested scientists and educators to join us in developing a Master's curriculum tailored to the unique needs, interests, and challenges of RSE.
Each module in the curriculum represents a specific area of the RSE landscape and will be shaped by community-driven short online workshops (2–3 hours each).

Dear Mr./ Mrs. [name]

as an expert in [...] we would like to invite you to a workshop as part of the effort to develop a RSE master curriculum.
Each module in the curriculum represents a specific area of the RSE landscape and will be shaped by community-driven short online workshops (2–3 hours each).

The main idea is to _supplement_ general courses on software engineering, data science and advanced science classes with RSE-specific courses tailored to the growing field of software engineering in research. Mapping necessary required basic courses is part the process.

These example modules will be new in structure and content and provide universities a suggestion how to hire and support the growing need for RSE competencies. These courses will be optional in the sense that alternatives or similar
existing classes will be suggested if a specialized lecturer is not available.

In these workshops, we collaboratively define:

- Relevant competences
- Suggested course structures
- RSE-specific perspectives

These efforts will feed directly into the development of a comprehensive and inclusive RSE Master's curriculum.
You can explore the broader project here: [RSE Masters Curriculum GitHub Repository](https://github.com/the-teachingRSE-project/RSE-Masters/tree/tschira-funding)

To get involved, please reach out via the repository or contact the organizing team directly at julian.dehne@gi.de.

For the expert meetings we can accommodate the schedule of the participants!
